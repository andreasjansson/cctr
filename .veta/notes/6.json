  "body": "On Windows, `bash` in PATH may point to WSL's bash.exe (in C:\\Windows\\System32) which:\n1. Doesn't work with Windows filesystem paths  \n2. Errors out asking you to install a WSL distribution\n\nv0.23.1 tried to fix this by hardcoding Git Bash path, but that broke systems without Git Bash.\n\nv0.23.2 fix: Use OnceLock to cache bash detection. Try `bash -c 'echo ok'` first - if it returns 'ok', use PATH bash. Otherwise fall back to Git Bash at C:\\Program Files\\Git\\bin\\bash.exe.\n\nAdded test/windows/bash.txt to verify bash works on Windows CI.",
