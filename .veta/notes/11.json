  "body": "v0.29+ adds persistent variables: variables captured in one test case persist to subsequent tests in the same file. Implementation: run_corpus_file accumulates a HashMap<String, Value> (persistent_vars) across tests. run_test receives prior_vars and returns newly captured vars. Matcher::matches merges prior_vars with new captures for constraint evaluation. Only passing tests contribute to persistent_vars. Variables can be overridden by later tests.",
